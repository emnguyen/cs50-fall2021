            // TODO: Add code to check answers to questions

            // For an outline of what we're doing: we first check for whether anything with the "correct" class has been clicked,
            // and if so we turn the background color of that button to green and say 'Correct!'. The same for whether "incorrect" has been clicked.
            // The same follows for the free response, and I'll get into the details down there.

            // We first need to check that the content of the website has been loaded, which will activate this searching.
            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {

                // Here, we create a variable called correct, which is basically the button of the correct answer, which we find using
                // document.querySelector and we want to use '.correct' since we used a class for that button.
                // Then, we add an event listener to check if the correct button has been clicked. When it has been clicked, we run this
                // function that will change the background color of the button to green (line 24). We also want it to say 'Correct!'
                // which we do by selecting the tag that has '#feedback1', which is the paragraph tag after the buttons, and change what
                // is inside to say 'Correct!' (it was empty before). And then we are done if the correct button was clicked!
                let correct = document.querySelector('.correct');
                correct.addEventListener('click', function() {
                    correct.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
                    document.querySelector('#feedback1').innerHTML = 'Correct!';
                });

                // The process is basically the same for if the incorrect button has been clicked. The only difference is that we have more than
                // one incorrect answer, so we instead need to use document.querySelectorAll, and we place all of the buttons that have the incorrect
                // class into an array (line 33). Then, we want to loop through the array (line 34), and do the same thing as the correct, where
                // we check if it has been clicked and change the background to red and the innerHTML to say 'Incorrect'. One thing to note is that
                // everything is case sensitive, so make sure you're careful about that!
                let incorrect = document.querySelectorAll('.incorrect');
                for (let i = 0; i < incorrect.length; i++) {
                    incorrect[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
                        incorrect[i].style.backgroundColor = 'red';
                        document.querySelector('#feedback1').innerHTML = 'Incorrect';
                    });
                }

                // Last thing we want to do is check the free response question. We're searching for the tag with the id 'check', which is the button
                // the user presses to check the FRQ. When this button has been clicked, we then activate this function.
                // Within the function, we first declare this variable "input," which is just the input of what has been put in the text box. We
                // are able to access this by selecting the "input" tag, and we know that there's only one.
                // Then, we check if the input is equal to whatever phrase is the correct phrase. If it is correct, we change the background of the
                // box to green (line 52) by changing the style, and then change the innerHTML of the paragraph tag to correct.
                // If it's not equal to the correct answer, then, we change the background color to red (line 57) and say 'Incorrect' (line 57).
                document.querySelector('#check').addEventListener('click', function() {
                    let input = document.querySelector('input');
                    if (input.value === 'Eliot') {
